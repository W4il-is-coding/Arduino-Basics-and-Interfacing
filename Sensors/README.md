# Sensors

This folder contains Arduino programs for interfacing and working with various sensors
commonly used in embedded systems and IoT applications.

## Sensors Covered
- Ultrasonic Sensor (Distance measurement)
- Infrared (IR) Sensor
- DHT Sensor (Temperature and Humidity)
- And other basic sensors

## Description
The programs in this folder demonstrate how to read sensor data using Arduino,
process the input signals, and use them for basic decision-making and control.

Each code is written in a simple and beginner-friendly manner to help understand
sensor working principles, pin connections, and data acquisition techniques.

## Purpose
- Learn sensor interfacing with Arduino
- Understand real-time data reading from sensors
- Practice embedded systems and hardware interaction

## Platform
- Arduino UNO
- Arduino IDE
- Basic electronic components
